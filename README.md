# Interactive Image Background Removal
Hi, 
This project provides an interactive web-based tool that allows users to remove the background of an image using a bounding box selection. The web application consists of a frontend interface to upload an image and draw a bounding box, and a backend that processes the image, removes the background, and returns the processed image for download.
Additionally, the project integrates Google Vision for object detection within the bounding box. This functionality can help improve the accuracy of background removal by identifying objects, although it has not yet been deployed. Will be deployed soon in next Update! ðŸ˜Š
